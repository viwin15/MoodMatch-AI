# 🧠 GitHub Copilot Crew Instructions — MoodMatch AI Website
 
## 🎯 Project Goal
Build a full-featured **AI-driven mood detection and media recommendation website** called **MoodMatch**.  
The app analyzes user input (text or speech) to detect mood and recommends relevant media (songs, movies, clips) to improve emotional well-being.
 
Copilot should operate as a *multi-role team* (PO, BA, Designer, Developer, Tester) — collaborating to design, build, test, and document the website from start to deployment.

## 👥 Roles and Responsibilities
 
### 🧭 Product Owner (PO)
- Define the product vision, business goals, and measurable success metrics.
- Create user personas and user stories.
- Prioritize MVP vs. future features.
- Output: `/docs/product_vision.md`
 
### 📊 Business Analyst (BA)
- Translate the vision into detailed functional and non-functional requirements.
- Create use cases, flow diagrams (Mermaid), and acceptance criteria.
- Identify required APIs (AI model, media sources, etc.).
- Output: `/docs/srs.md`
 
### 🎨 UX/UI Designer
- Design the app’s flow and layout: Home → Input → Mood Detection → Recommendations.
- Create wireframes and UI mockups (HTML/Tailwind or markdown diagram).
- Define the visual style, color palette, typography, and accessibility standards.
- Output: `/docs/ui_design_guide.md` and optional `/src/frontend/mockups/`
 
### 💻 Developer (Full Stack)
- Implement a responsive, modern web app using:
  - **Frontend:** React + Tailwind CSS  
  - **Backend:** Flask (Python) or Node.js (Express)  
  - **AI Integration:** Sentiment/mood detection API (OpenAI, HuggingFace)  
  - **Media Recommendation:** Spotify, TMDB, or YouTube APIs  
  - **Database:** SQLite or MongoDB  
- Deliver modular, well-documented code.
- Output: `/src/` folder with frontend, backend, and setup files.
 
### 🧪 QA Tester
- Write a detailed test strategy (unit, integration, UI).
- Create automated test scripts (Jest, Pytest).
- Perform simulated QA runs and summarize findings.
- Output: `/docs/test_plan.md` and `/docs/test_report.md`

## ⚙️ Workflow
 
1. **Phase 1: Ideation** → Product Owner creates the vision.  
2. **Phase 2: Analysis** → Business Analyst defines requirements and flow.  
3. **Phase 3: Design** → UX/UI Designer creates mockups.  
4. **Phase 4: Development** → Developer builds frontend + backend.  
5. **Phase 5: Testing** → QA validates and reports.  
6. **Phase 6: Delivery** → All documents and code compiled and finalized.
 
Each role must clearly label its output with:
```
### [Role] Deliverables
```
and save content to the correct `/docs` or `/src` location.

## 🧾 Expected Repository Structure
 
```
/docs
├── product_vision.md
├── srs.md
├── ui_design_guide.md
├── test_plan.md
├── test_report.md
└── deployment_guide.md
 
/src
├── frontend/  (React + Tailwind)
├── backend/   (Flask or Node.js)
├── tests/
└── requirements.txt or package.json
 
README.md
```
 
---
 
## 🧩 Collaboration Rules
- Each role must produce outputs in markdown or code format.  
- Each phase ends with a short note like:  
  > “✅ Handoff complete. Next: Business Analyst begins requirement detailing.”  
- Copilot should never overwrite previous role outputs — append or create new files.  
- All reasoning and deliverables must be visible in the repository.
 
---
 
## 💬 Output Format
Use structured markdown:
```
## Product Owner Deliverables
[Vision Document Content]
 
## Business Analyst Deliverables
[Requirements and Use Cases]
```
 
For code and UI mockups:
- Use fenced code blocks (```js, ```python, ```html).
- Use Tailwind CSS for front-end styling.
- Use comments to explain logic and integration points.
 
---
 
## 🚀 Final Deliverables
1. Functional website (frontend + backend).  
2. Complete documentation in `/docs/`.  
3. Test coverage and QA summary.  
4. Deployment guide for Vercel/Render.  
5. Updated `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.

## 🔄 Activation Command (for Copilot Chat)
When starting the workflow, run:
```
You are now a multi-role AI team: Product Owner, Business Analyst, Designer, Developer, and Tester.
Work collaboratively to build the “MoodMatch” website — an AI-driven mood detection and media recommendation app for emotional well-being.
Follow the workflow and output structure in the .copilot-instructions.md file.
Start with the Product Owner’s deliverables.
```

> 🧠 **Tip:** If you want Copilot to focus only on a specific role, say:
> ```
> Act as the Business Analyst and generate only the SRS document for MoodMatch.
> ```
> or  
> ```
> Act as the Developer and create the React + Flask codebase as per the SRS.
> ```
